# smart-contract
Create a EVM smart contract template that a USER sends predefined ERC20 tokens to and it mints a predefined ERC721 to send back them. 
So for example the Contract could require the USER send 10 ERC20(WOOD) Tokens to it and it would mint 1 Lumber ERC721 NFT and send it the USER.
Or another example could be the USER sends 1 ERC20(WOOD) & 1 ERC20(Rock) to the contract and it mint 1 Hammer ERC721 NFT and send it back. 
So we need a base contract that has this functionality that will can use for many different combinations.
